# Key-Phrase-Extractor

## Introduction
One way of understanding and speeding up the consumption of unstructured text by end-users is to automatically extract
so-called “key concepts” and order them in a meaningful way. Performing analytics over such extractions becomes a key 
task to facilitate knowledge acquisition and curation.

## Objective
You will operate on an in-house collection of patent documents. It is your task to parse these patents and to semantically 
enrich them using key concept/phrase extraction so that users can later quickly review documents by looking only at them
instead of reading the text. To support that, you should store the key phrases and document identifiers in a 
data structure or database that supports fast retrieval for analytics purposes.  As an additional use-case, please 
generate a meaningful ordering of the top-30 key phrases also for every document that could help to understand the main theme.
